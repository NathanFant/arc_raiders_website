Build Order:
1. Database Setup (do this first)

Set up SQLAlchemy models
Configure Alembic for migrations
Create initial tables

2. Authentication System (critical foundation)

User model & registration
Login/JWT tokens
Password hashing
Auth dependencies (for protecting routes)

3. Basic CRUD patterns (learn the patterns)

Start with something simple like a "User Profile" endpoint
This teaches you the model → schema → route pattern

4. Weapons/Gear Data (your actual content)

Weapon models (stats, types, etc.)
Seed the database with game data
Read-only endpoints (no auth needed initially)

5. Loadouts (ties it together)

Loadout model (references weapons + user)
CRUD operations (requires auth)
This is where you use everything you built

6. Social Features (polish)

Voting/rating system
Comments
Popular/trending endpoints
